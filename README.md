* [Live Demo](https://kv-go-schedule-generator-production.up.railway.app/)

# Background
[KV Go](https://www.quispamsis.ca/home-streets-and-utilities/kv-go) is a free public transit service provided by the municipalities of [Quispamsis](https://www.quispamsis.ca/) and [Rothesay](https://www.rothesay.ca/), New Brunswick.

Currently, KV Go's [bus schedule](https://www.quispamsis.ca/media/0qkjoy2l/kv-go-bus-route-times-25aug20.pdf) is only available as a PDF with large tables showing each run's stops and times. For frequent commuters, this can be inconvenient and time-consuming having to read through and manually plan recurring trips. With this tool, you can create personalized stop events for scheduling and afterwards export it as a formatted .ics file that you can import into any calendar app.
